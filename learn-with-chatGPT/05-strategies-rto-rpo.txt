Certainly! Here's a sorted list of the cloud disaster recovery strategies based on their Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO), starting with the fastest recovery times:

1. Hot Standby:
   - RPO: Near-zero data loss (real-time replication)
   - RTO: Minimal downtime, near-instant failover

2. Warm Standby:
   - RPO: Minimal data loss (up-to-date replication)
   - RTO: Faster recovery compared to backup and restore, reduced downtime

3. Cloud-to-Cloud:
   - RPO: Depends on replication frequency and synchronization
   - RTO: Can vary but generally offers faster recovery times than backup and restore

4. Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS):
   - RPO: Depends on service provider and configuration
   - RTO: Can vary but generally offers faster recovery times than backup and restore

5. Backup and Restore:
   - RPO: Depends on backup frequency, can result in some data loss
   - RTO: Longer recovery times compared to other strategies

It's important to note that the RPO and RTO times can vary depending on the specific implementation, the scale of the infrastructure, the volume of data, and other factors. Organizations should carefully evaluate their requirements, resources, and budget constraints to determine the most appropriate strategy for their disaster recovery needs.
